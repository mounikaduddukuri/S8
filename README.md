# S8

- we separated the ResNet code files and saved in google drive as resnetmodel, and uploaded to github 

- we used dataloader, datatransform, modelstats and model trainer from google drive library created for S7 assignment.

- [we changed the code to increase the accuracy by adding softmax](https://github.com/DrVenkataRajeshKumar/S8/blob/master/resnetmodel.py)

- [We changed the code to replace FC layer to point wise convolution layer](https://github.com/DrVenkataRajeshKumar/S8/blob/master/rn.py)

- [we got 85% accuracy at 8th EPOCH and 90% accuracy at 13th EPOCH](https://github.com/DrVenkataRajeshKumar/S8/blob/master/S8withoutFC.ipynb)
